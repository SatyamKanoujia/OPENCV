I have learned everything I need to know about OpenCV through a comprehensive course designed for beginners. Starting from the basics such as reading images and videos, and performing image transformations, I progressed to more advanced concepts like understanding color spaces and edge detection.

As I delved deeper into the course, I gained hands-on experience in building a Deep Computer Vision model. The culmination of my learning journey was the practical application of this knowledge to classify characters from the renowned TV series "The Simpsons."
